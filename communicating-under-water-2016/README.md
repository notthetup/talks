# Communicating Under Water

## Outline
- Why?
- How?
- Where?

## Details.

### Future of Underwater Wireless
### Why? 70% of earth is underwater (earth water pacific)
### Comms is critical to be able to (communications/data, )
 - measure
 - monitor
 - fix water problems

### Problems with cables (cables)
  - Cable Management (cable management ships, https://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=1&f=5&t=1839489)
  - Breaking (broken cable, https://i.imgur.com/zNK6lwS.jpg)
  - Cost (large spool of cable, https://i.imgur.com/JSiiyRp.jpg)

### Traditional comms
 - RF over Air (antennas, https://www.flickr.com/photos/elzey/6443586511/)
  - Range (Satellite, https://www.flickr.com/photos/kordite/16982362655)
  - Data rate (SpeedTest.net)

### But RF in Water!! (RF Absorption Graph)
### Other options? Optical (Murky Water)

### Sound Waves ? (Sound Wave)
  - `Dolphins/Waves do it` (Dolphin/Whale, https://www.flickr.com/photos/8058098@N07/2718571627/)

### Has this been done before?
  - Networking over Telephony (Modem signup spectrogram, https://www.flickr.com/photos/bushman_k/11347089493)
  - `Concept isn't new`

###  Challenges (deployment)
  - Bandwidth (data rate graphs)
    - `Data Rate == Bandwidth`
    - `Bandwidth limited by propagation loss`
  - Noise (Signal + Snapping Shrimp)
    - Snapping Shrimps. (snapping shrimp gif, https://imgur.com/gallery/aPvFgr9)
  - Delay (TCP ping pong)
    - `Delay in networking protocols.`
    - `network protocols designed assuming low delay`

### Solutions
- Custom Software (screen shot of DSP code)
  - `Signal Processing`
- Custom Networking (screen from UNet Stack)
  - `UNET Stack`
- Custom Hardware (close up of Modem electronics)
  - `Analog + Digital`

### Modems (Modem Pictures)
- WiFi Router for Underwater!
- Types of Modems, Deployments.

### Use Cases
  - Sensing (sensor networks)
    - Sea bottom sensors (subnero graphics)

  - AUV/ROV Comms (open ROV, https://www.flickr.com/photos/tamberg/19371920922)
    - Tether (ROV teather, https://www.cinema5d.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Trident_Underwater_Drone_1.jpg)
    - Video link (ROV video)

  - Actuation (subsea pipes, http://binscorner.com/pages/u/underwater-welding.html)
    - `Oil and Gas`
